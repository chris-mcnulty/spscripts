# Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1

## Overview
This PowerShell script enumerates usage reports from all SharePoint sites in a tenant and exports the data to a CSV file. It provides comprehensive site usage statistics including storage usage, activity dates, file counts, and more.

## Features
- **Three Methods**: Choose between Microsoft Graph API, SharePoint Online Management Shell, or a Combined mode that merges the best of both
- **Comprehensive Data**: Collects detailed usage statistics for all sites in the tenant
- **Automatic Module Installation**: Detects and installs required PowerShell modules
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress when processing multiple sites
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging
- **Flexible Output**: Customizable CSV output path with automatic timestamping
- **Summary Statistics**: Displays aggregate statistics after export

## Prerequisites

### For SharePoint Online Management Shell Method (Default)
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell module (auto-installed if missing)
- SharePoint Administrator or Global Administrator role

### For Microsoft Graph API Method
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Microsoft.Graph.Reports module (auto-installed if missing)
- Microsoft.Graph.Authentication module (auto-installed if missing)
- Reports.Read.All, Sites.Read.All, and ReportSettings.ReadWrite.All permissions

### For Combined Mode
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- All modules from both methods above (auto-installed if missing)
- Both SharePoint Administrator role and Graph API permissions

## Installation

1. Download the script:
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chris-mcnulty/spscripts.git
cd spscripts
```

2. Ensure you have appropriate permissions in your SharePoint tenant

3. Run the script (modules will be auto-installed if needed)

## Usage

### Basic Usage (SharePoint Online Management Shell)
```powershell
.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 -TenantName "contoso"
```
This will:
- Connect to contoso.sharepoint.com
- Retrieve usage data for all sites
- Export to a timestamped CSV file in the current directory

### Using Microsoft Graph API
```powershell
.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 -TenantName "contoso" -UseGraphAPI
```
This method provides additional metrics like page views and active file counts.

### Combined Mode (Best of Both)
```powershell
.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 -TenantName "contoso" -UseCombined
```
This mode uses SPO as the source of truth for site inventory (Title, URL, Owner — never obfuscated), then attaches Graph usage metrics (page views, file counts, activity dates). SPO URLs are resolved to Graph SiteIds using path-based addressing (`Get-MgSite -SiteId "contoso.sharepoint.com:/sites/SiteName:"`), which avoids `getAllSites` and works with delegated permissions.

### Specify Output Path
```powershell
.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 -TenantName "contoso" -OutputPath "C:\Reports\MyUsageReport.csv"
```

### Complete Example with All Parameters
```powershell
.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 `
    -TenantName "contoso" `
    -OutputPath "C:\Reports\usage.csv" `
    -AuthMethod "Interactive" `
    -UseGraphAPI
```

## Parameters

| TenantName | String | Yes | - | Your SharePoint tenant name (e.g., 'contoso' for contoso.sharepoint.com) |
| OutputPath | String | No | Auto-generated | Full path for the output CSV file. If not specified, creates a timestamped file in script directory |
| AuthMethod | String | No | Interactive | Authentication method: 'Interactive', 'Certificate', or 'ClientSecret' |
| UseGraphAPI | Switch | No | False | Use Microsoft Graph API instead of SharePoint Online Management Shell |
| UseCombined | Switch | No | False | Combine SPO Management Shell (friendly names) with Graph API (page views/activity) into a single report |

## Output Data

### SharePoint Online Management Shell Method
The CSV file includes:
- **SiteUrl**: Full URL of the site
- **Title**: Site title
- **Owner**: Site owner email/username
- **Template**: Site template type
- **Status**: Site status (Active, ReadOnly, etc.)
- **StorageQuotaMB**: Storage quota in megabytes
- **StorageUsedMB**: Current storage usage in megabytes
- **StorageUsedPercentage**: Percentage of storage quota used
- **LastContentModifiedDate**: Date of last content modification
- **SharingCapability**: External sharing settings
- **LockState**: Site lock status
- **WebsCount**: Number of subsites
- **IsHubSite**: Whether the site is a hub site
- **HubSiteId**: Hub site ID if connected to a hub
- **SensitivityLabel**: Applied sensitivity label
- **CreatedDate**: Site creation date

### Microsoft Graph API Method
The Graph method retrieves usage data — including page views — as follows:

1. The script calls `Get-MgReportSharePointSiteUsageDetail -Period D7`, which wraps the Microsoft Graph REST API endpoint [`getSharePointSiteUsageDetail`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/reportroot-getsharepointsiteusagedetail).
2. That endpoint returns a CSV report where each row is a site and columns include `Page View Count` and `Visited Page Count`.
3. The script parses the CSV with `ConvertFrom-Csv` and maps those columns to the output fields listed below.

Page views are tracked server-side by SharePoint and surfaced through this report; there is no separate API call to fetch them.

The CSV file includes:
- **SiteUrl**: Full URL of the site
- **SiteId**: Unique site identifier
- **OwnerDisplayName**: Display name of the owner
- **OwnerPrincipalName**: Owner's principal name
- **IsDeleted**: Whether the site is deleted
- **LastActivityDate**: Date of last activity
- **FileCount**: Total number of files
- **ActiveFileCount**: Number of active files
- **PageViewCount**: Number of page views (from the report's `Page View Count` column)
- **VisitedPageCount**: Number of distinct pages visited (from the report's `Visited Page Count` column)
- **StorageUsedInBytes**: Storage used in bytes
- **StorageAllocatedInBytes**: Allocated storage in bytes
- **RootWebTemplate**: Site template
- **ReportRefreshDate**: When the report was generated
- **ReportPeriod**: Report period (e.g., last 7 days)

### Combined Mode
The combined mode uses SPO as the source of truth for site inventory and enriches each site with Graph usage metrics. The CSV file includes:
- **SiteUrl**: Full URL of the site (from SPO — always reliable)
- **Title**: Site title (from SPO)
- **Owner**: Site owner email/username (from SPO)
- **Template**: Site template type (from SPO)
- **StorageUsedMB**: Current storage usage in megabytes (from SPO)
- **StorageQuotaMB**: Storage quota in megabytes (from SPO)
- **StorageUsedPercentage**: Percentage of storage quota used (from SPO)
- **LastContentModifiedDate**: Date of last content modification (from SPO)
- **LastActivityDate**: Date of last activity (from Graph)
- **FileCount**: Total number of files (from Graph)
- **ActiveFileCount**: Number of active files (from Graph)
- **PageViewCount**: Number of page views in last 7 days (from Graph)
- **VisitedPageCount**: Number of distinct pages visited in last 7 days (from Graph)
- **SharingCapability**: External sharing settings (from SPO)
- **LockState**: Site lock status (from SPO)
- **IsHubSite**: Whether the site is a hub site (from SPO)
- **HubSiteId**: Hub site ID if connected to a hub (from SPO)
- **SensitivityLabel**: Applied sensitivity label (from SPO)
- **RootWebTemplate**: Site template (from Graph)
- **IsDeleted**: Whether the site has been deleted (from Graph)
- **CreatedDate**: Site creation date (from SPO)
- **ReportRefreshDate**: When the Graph report was generated

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Report for Contoso Tenant
```powershell
.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 -TenantName "contoso"
```
Output: `SPO_SiteUsage_contoso_20260212_143022.csv`

### Example 2: Detailed Report Using Graph API
```powershell
.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 -TenantName "fabrikam" -UseGraphAPI -OutputPath "D:\Reports\Fabrikam_Usage.csv"
```
Provides additional metrics like page views and active file counts.

### Example 3: Combined Report with Friendly Names and Page Views
```powershell
.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 -TenantName "contoso" -UseCombined -OutputPath "C:\Reports\Combined_Usage.csv"
```
Merges SPO friendly site info (titles, owners, storage in MB) with Graph activity metrics (page views, active files).

### Example 4: Automated Monthly Report
```powershell
# Schedule this script to run monthly via Task Scheduler
$monthYear = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM"
$outputPath = "\\fileserver\Reports\SharePoint\Usage_$monthYear.csv"

.\Get-SPOSiteUsageReports.ps1 -TenantName "contoso" -OutputPath $outputPath -UseGraphAPI
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Module Installation Fails
**Solution**: Run PowerShell as Administrator or use `-Scope CurrentUser` when installing modules manually:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

### Issue: Authentication Fails
**Solution**: Ensure you have the required permissions:
- For SPO method: SharePoint Administrator or Global Administrator
- For Graph method: Reports.Read.All and Sites.Read.All permissions

### Issue: Script Takes Too Long
**Solution**: 
- Use the `-UseGraphAPI` switch for faster processing
- The Graph API method is generally faster for large tenants
- For SPO method, the script processes sites one by one with progress indicators

### Issue: Some Sites Missing from Report
**Solution**:
- Check that you have access to all sites
- Personal sites are excluded by default; modify the script if needed
- Some sites may be hidden or require special permissions

### Issue: Graph API Returns Obfuscated Data (Zeroed SiteIds, Hashed Names)
**Solution**: The Microsoft 365 admin center has a privacy setting called **"Conceal user, group, and site names in all reports"** that causes the Graph Reports API to return hashed owner names, zeroed-out Site IDs, and empty Site URLs.

The script now handles this automatically:
1. **Uses SPO as source of truth** — `Get-SPOSite` reliably returns Title, URL, and Owner even when the Graph Reports API is obfuscated
2. **Resolves SiteIds via path-based addressing** — `Get-MgSite -SiteId "hostname:/sites/Name:"` returns the Graph compound site ID from any SPO URL, without needing `getAllSites` or app-only permissions
3. **Checks the admin setting** via `(Get-MgAdminReportSetting).DisplayConcealedNames` and **attempts to disable it** via `Update-MgAdminReportSetting -DisplayConcealedNames:$false` (requires `ReportSettings.ReadWrite.All` permission)
4. **Graph-only mode fallback**: resolves blank URLs via `Get-MgSite` compound IDs, and falls back to the Sites API for fully obfuscated data

**Important notes:**
- In combined mode (`-UseCombined`), SPO metadata (Title, URL, Owner) is always available regardless of Graph obfuscation
- Graph usage columns (PageViewCount, FileCount, etc.) may be empty if the Graph report SiteIds are zeroed out
- After disabling the concealment setting, report data can take **up to 48 hours** to reflect the change
- Grant `ReportSettings.ReadWrite.All` permission for automatic setting correction

## Permissions Required

### SharePoint Online Management Shell Method
- SharePoint Administrator role, or
- Global Administrator role

### Microsoft Graph API Method
Application permissions needed:
- Reports.Read.All
- Sites.Read.All
- ReportSettings.ReadWrite.All (for automatic concealment setting detection and correction)

Or delegated permissions:
- Reports.Read.All
- Sites.Read.All
- ReportSettings.ReadWrite.All (optional, but recommended)

## Best Practices

1. **Run during off-peak hours**: For large tenants, run the script during off-peak hours to minimize impact
2. **Regular exports**: Schedule regular exports to track usage trends over time
3. **Store securely**: Store output CSV files in a secure location as they contain sensitive information
4. **Review permissions**: Regularly review and ensure you have the minimum required permissions
5. **Graph API for scale**: For tenants with 1000+ sites, use the Graph API method for better performance

## Limitations

- Personal sites (OneDrive) are excluded by default in the SPO method
- Graph API method provides data for the last 7 days by default
- Rate limiting may occur with very large tenants (10,000+ sites)
- Some fields may be empty depending on site configuration and permissions

## Version History

- **2.0.0** (2026-02-13): SPO-first combined mode with `Get-MgSite` path-based addressing
  - Combined mode now uses SPO as source of truth for site inventory (Title, URL, Owner — never obfuscated)
  - Resolves SPO URLs to Graph SiteIds via `Get-MgSite -SiteId "hostname:/sites/Name:"` — avoids `getAllSites` entirely
  - Matches SPO sites to Graph usage report by URL first, then by resolved SiteId
  - Graph connection managed independently from SPO (no session lifecycle issues)
  - Graceful degradation: returns SPO-only data if Graph connection fails
  - Validates Graph permissions at start of combined mode
- **1.4.2** (2026-02-12): Fix three bugs preventing Graph-to-SPO matching
  - Fixed `Get-MgSite` to use compound SiteId format (`hostname,siteGuid,siteGuid`) instead of simple GUIDs
  - Fixed Graph session being disconnected before combined mode could use it (`-KeepConnection` switch)
  - Fixed sites search fallback using invalid `?search=*` syntax (now uses tenant name as search term)
- **1.4.1** (2026-02-12): Get-MgSite lookup for blank-URL sites
  - For Graph sites with valid SiteIds but blank URLs, calls `Get-MgSite -SiteId` to resolve displayName and webUrl
  - Applied in both Graph-only mode (resolves blank URLs before obfuscation check) and combined mode (third matching step after URL and SiteId)
  - Resolved webUrl is then used to match back to SPO for full metadata in combined mode
- **1.4.0** (2026-02-12): Reversed combined mode — Graph-first approach
  - Combined mode now starts from Graph report data (authoritative list with SiteIds and all usage metrics)
  - Each Graph site row is enriched with SPO metadata (Title, Owner, Template, etc.) when a match is found
  - Eliminates duplicate rows that occurred when starting from SPO and appending unmatched Graph sites
  - Matching: URL first, then SiteId (SPO URLs resolved to Graph SiteIds via `/sites/{hostname}:/{path}`)
- **1.3.0** (2026-02-12): SiteId-based matching for combined mode
  - Combined mode now falls back to SiteId-based matching when Graph report URLs are blank/obfuscated
  - Each SPO site URL is resolved to its Graph Site ID via `/sites/{hostname}:/{path}`, then matched to Graph report data by SiteId
  - Unmatched SPO sites are enriched with per-site analytics (page views, file counts) via direct Graph API calls
  - URL-based matching remains the preferred first pass when Graph URLs are available
- **1.2.1** (2026-02-12): Use proper Graph SDK cmdlets for report settings
  - Replaced raw `Invoke-MgGraphRequest` calls with `Get-MgAdminReportSetting` and `Update-MgAdminReportSetting` for reliable concealment setting detection and correction
  - Added explicit logging of the actual `DisplayConcealedNames` value so users can confirm the setting
- **1.2.0** (2026-02-12): Graph API obfuscation handling
  - Automatic detection of obfuscated Graph report data (zeroed SiteIds, hashed names)
  - Proactive check and correction of the admin report-privacy concealment setting
  - Sites API fallback (`/sites/getAllSites`) for real site metadata when reports are obfuscated
  - Per-site analytics enrichment via `/sites/{id}/analytics/lastSevenDays` and `/sites/{id}/drive` to retrieve page views, file counts, storage, and last activity dates even when the report is obfuscated
  - Improved combined mode diagnostics when partial metrics are unavailable
- **1.1.0** (2026-02-12): Combined mode
  - New `-UseCombined` switch merges SPO + Graph data into one report
  - Friendly names/owners from SPO with page views/activity from Graph
- **1.0.0** (2026-02-12): Initial release
  - Support for SharePoint Online Management Shell
  - Support for Microsoft Graph API
  - Automatic module installation
  - Comprehensive usage data export
  - Progress tracking and error handling
